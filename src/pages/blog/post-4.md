I wish I could say this was a case of great minds thinking alike.

Alas, I know Andy Fitzgerald too well to pretend to be at his level of braininess.

But I can at least lay claim to some good timing.

Less than 24 hours after I launched the KnowledgeGraph.me website, Andy published an article on his [UX methods knowledge graph project](https://www.andyfitzgeraldconsulting.com/writing/boutique-knowledge-graph-ux-methods/).

In his LinkedIn posting about that article he said, "My sense is that the benefits of semantically enhanced content are potentially game changing for sites of any size."

I could not agree more.

Knowledge graphs shouldn't be only for enterprises and big web search engines.

We can all benefit from organizing our content and other information around ***what it means*** as well as what it is.

Or, as Andy says:

"Where enterprise knowledge graphs are typically used to support large scale data integration, frequently on the scale of billions of resources, a boutique knowledge graph brings the benefits of graph data tools and processes to smaller scale projects.

"The semantic technologies on which knowledge graphs of any size are built are predominately created from open standards. They are also widely supported by an ever-growing collection of open source tools. While the techniques of graph-based knowledge management have not frequently been applied at a small scale, their semantically enhanced foundations are potentially game changing for sites of any size."

I'm excited about the prospects of knowledge graphs to help professionals, small businesses, startups, and other non-enterprise-scale organizations. I hope you are, too.
